# Epidemic Models
### COVID-19 Pandemic in Mexico (2020-2022)
**First steps for the Analysis of the Pandemic using Epidemic Models**

## Description
During the COVID-19 pandemic, daily infection cases were processed and reported through public databases by CONACYT. For privacy reasons, I cannot disclose all the details about the Epidemic Models we implemented. However, I can provide an overview of some of the preparations required for the later analysis, including the data cleaning process and infected waves identification.

## Usage
The project is built in Jupyter Notebook (Python), and all the necessary data is provided to run the code.
### Results
The program initially includes outputs for preview. As a result of running the program, new data files will be generated after the cleaning process, as well as storing the resulting figures.

## Example Output
<div style='align-content: center;'>
  <img style='width: 50%;' src='images/PandemicMexico.png'>
  <p style='font-size:8px;'>Pandemic in Mexico (2020-2022)</p>
</div>
